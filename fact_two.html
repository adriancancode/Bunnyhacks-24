                Day and night are almost equal on the first day of spring.
                On the first day of spring, the world has a phenomenon called the vernal equinox, where the Sun
                crosses the equator and gives the world around 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of nighttime.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word "equinox" is of Latin origin, coming from the words "aequi", meaning "equal", and "nox", meaning "night".
